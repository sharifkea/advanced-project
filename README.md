We are doing our Project
AI-Driven Continuous Risk Assessment System to Predict Heart Failure 
Our system aims to predict an individualâ€™s risk of heart failure by combining general population-level 
data with personalized time-series monitoring. The first model is trained with a Heart Disease 
related dataset to learn general risk patterns across diverse patient profiles. The second model 
focuses on continuous heart rate data generated for a specific person, capturing personalized 
variations over time. By integrating these two models, the system can provide a more accurate and 
personalized risk prediction, offering both broad medical insight and individual-specific monitoring.
